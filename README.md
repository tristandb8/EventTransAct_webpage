## <b>Webpage template</b>

This webpage template was made for a [colorful ECCV paper](http://tristandb8.github.io/colorization/). See how the webpage looks [here](https://tristandb8.github.io/webpage-template).

To use this template, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/tristandb8/EventTransAct.git
```

Copy the contents into a `gh-pages` branch of a GitHub repo. That will automatically make a webpage under address [GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME](GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME).
